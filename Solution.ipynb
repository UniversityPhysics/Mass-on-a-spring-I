    "# Model the spring force\n",
    "Let's call the current length of the spring $L$ and relaxed length of the spring $L_0$. Then magnitude of the spring force $F_{sp}$ is proportional to the stretch $\\left(L-L_0\\right)$:  $$F=k_s \\left(\\vec{L}-\\vec{L}_0\\right)$$. A more convenient way to express this vector is in terms of a unit vector in the direction of $\\vec{L}$. Recall that a unit vector is calculated as $\\hat{L}=\\vec{L}/|L|$ and a convenient way to code this in Python is `Lhat = norm(L)`. Therefore, a vector expression for the spring force can be written in either of these two ways:\n",
    "$$\\vec{F}=-k_s \\left(\\vec{L}-\\vec{L}_0\\right) = \\left(L-L_0\\right)\\left(-\\hat{L}\\right)$$."

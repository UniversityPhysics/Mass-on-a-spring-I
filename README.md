# Mass on a spring

The computation itself comes from from Chabay and Sherwood's exercises VP07 and VP09 http://www.compadre.org/portal/items/detail.cfm?ID=5692#tabs. They have great learning activities in the assignments as well.

# Model the spring force

# Apply the model

# Extend the model
1. Create motion in 3D, rather than a plane, to generate a 3D Lisajous figure. 
2. Make a ``circular pendulum'', in which the ball simply traces out a circle without bouncing vertically. Do any necessary calculations in python. Make the angle an angle of 30 degrees.
3. Add air resistance. At what air density do you start noticing air drag? Start with an air density of rho=1.2 and increase.
